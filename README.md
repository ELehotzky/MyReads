===================

*About*
=======
This app is a book tracker, where you can search the API by the book's name/author and add it to one of three bookshelves - currently reading, read, or want to read.

*Get Started*
=============
-If it's the first time you're running, be sure to run "npm install && npm start" in your command line. Once it's finished, your browser should automatically open you to the home page.

-You should see some books already on each of your shelves. You can play around with them by selecting the green down-arrow button on each title, and moving them between lists. Try it out!

-To add new books to your shelves, press the green "+" button in the lower right-hand corner. This will take you to the search page, where you can browse books by title or author.

-The search is dynamic - try typing in a few words or letters. If nothing matches your search, no books will appear below. Once you've found a book you'd like to add to a bookshelf, hit its green arrow to add to the correct shelf. To get back to your main homepage, click the left arrow in the top left corner.

*Dependencies*
=============
This app was built with JavaScript, React, and HTML/CSS.
